          I dislike subscription services -saying that I'm not a fan of them is
          an understatement. Recent years have demonstrated (Hulu, Amazon Prime,
          Netflix, Disney, HBO etc.)
          <!-- Add page with archived references for poor quality service -->
          that, despite increasing subscription fees, quality of service for the
          consumer continues to decline. Advertisements are inserted into the
          media, despite having paid to watch it. The media that we originally
          signed up to watch gets pulled from their service so we lose access to
          the content, or the media is moved to a different service so now we
          have to get two subscriptions. The only thing that one might
          successfully argue has improved is convenience associated with the
          subscription services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having such a perspective, for years, I have felt comfortable
          streaming media online from third-party streaming sites that do not
          require sign-up or charge fees under fair use. Unfortunately,
          copyright holders have been quite proficient at targeting these
          websites, and the quality of service on those websites has since
          declined quite substantially, impacting convenience (as a result, my
          three-year old knows and uses the term 'buffering').
        </p>
        <p>
          My original goal with learning to self-host my own media library was
          admittedly a bit vague: I wanted to do more than have some external
          hard drives with directories of files, but I wasn't certain I wanted
          to venture back into peer-to-peer file sharing after basically a
          decade of not doing so. There is additional risk with file sharing,
          and technology has gotten so complicated! I didn't understand most of
          what I was doing when I was downloading software from random sources
          on Napster and Limewire and cracking the software to use it without a
          key or using a key generator -I just wanted to play Age of Empires!
          The most recent time I'd torrented, I received a nasty-gram from my
          VPN provider so I hadn't attempted that since.
          <small>
            (all of this is completely hypothetical; I would never do something
            so illegal and irresponsible!)
          </small>
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I fell into an echo chamber online that was full of
          complete nerds and digital anarchists, and I didn't quite realize how
          polarized some of the group was initially. That echo chamber led me to
          learn about Linux, open-source software and self-hosting data and
          services. This latter point overlapped neatly with my frustration over
          lack of digital privacy, the normalization of extreme data leaks and
          leaks of the sensitive information of myself, my spouse and my infant
          child.

        <p>
          The digital anarchists touted a particular suite of software as making
          it elementary to access one's desired media, organize it and make it
          available to users -perfect! This is exactly what I was looking for:
          something presentable, navigable and easy to use for my spouse and
          small children. This suite of software was most easily installed on
          Linux, and I'd been looking to jump-ship from Windows at home for a
          while. I started ordering hardware to convert my desktop gaming pc
          (I'm more of a console guy anyways) to a home media server, installed
          <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php">
            Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)
          </a>
          on my laptop and researched home server operating systems. My interest
          in planning for the future (scalability), desire to customize and lack
          of familiarity with Terminals led me to
          <a href="https://unraid.net/"> Unraid </a>
          , a proprietary operating system based on slackware Linux that is
          wrapped in a friendly GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the year, I initiated enough projects that I feel like a golden
          retriever in a tennis ball court. Everything seemed so logical at the
          time, but I look around and see miscellaneous hardware from
          barely-begun or half-complete projects.
