          I dislike subscription services -saying that I'm not a fan of them is
          an understatement. Recent years have demonstrated (Hulu, Amazon Prime,
          Netflix, Disney, HBO etc.) that, despite increasing subscription fees,
          quality of service for the consumer continues to decline.
          Advertisements are inserted into the media, despite having paid to
          watch it. The media that we originally signed up to watch gets pulled
          from their service so we lose access to the content, or the media is
          moved to a different service so now we have to get two subscriptions.
          The only thing that one might successfully argue has improved is
          convenience associated with the subscription services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having such a perspective, for years, I have felt comfortable
          streaming media online from third-party streaming sites that do not
          require sign-up or charge fees under fair use. Unfortunately,
          copyright holders have been quite proficient at targeting these
          websites, and the quality of service on those websites has since
          declined quite substantially, impacting convenience (as a result, my
          three-year old knows and uses the term 'buffering').
        </p>
        <p>
          My original goal with learning to self-host my own media library was
          admittedly a bit vague: I wanted to do more than have some external
          hard drives with directories of files, but I wasn't certain I wanted
          to venture back into peer-to-peer file sharing after basically a
          decade of not doing so. There is additional risk with file sharing,
          and technology has gotten so complicated! I didn't understand most of
          what I was doing when I was downloading software from random sources
          on Napster and Limewire and cracking the software to use it without a
          key or using a key generator -I just wanted to play Age of Empires!
          The most recent time I'd torrented, I received a nasty-gram from my
          VPN provider so I hadn't attempted that since.

        <p>
          Eventually, I fell into an echo chamber online that was full of
          complete nerds and digital anarchists, and I initially didn't quite
          realize how polarized some of the group was. That echo chamber led me
          to learn about Linux, open-source software and self-hosting data and
          services. This latter point overlapped neatly with my frustration over
          lack of digital privacy, the normalization of extreme data leaks and
          leaks of the sensitive information of myself, my spouse and my infant
          child.

          The digital anarchists touted a particular suite of software as making
          it elementary to access one's desired media, organize it and make it
          available to users -perfect! This is exactly what I was looking for:
          something presentable, navigable and easy to use for my spouse and
          small children. This suite of software was most easily installed on
          Linux, and I'd been looking to jump-ship from Windows at home for a
          while. I started ordering hardware to convert my desktop gaming pc
          (I'm more of a console guy anyways) to a home media server, installed
          <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php" class="link">
            Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)
          </a>
          on my laptop and researched home server operating systems. My interest
          in planning for the future (scalability), desire to customize and lack
          of familiarity with Terminals led me to
          <a href="https://unraid.net/" class="link"> Unraid</a>, a proprietary
          operating system based on slackware Linux that is wrapped in a
          friendly GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the year, I had initiated enough projects that I felt like a
          golden retriever in a tennis ball court. Everything seemed so logical
          at the time, but I look around and see miscellaneous hardware from
          barely-begun or half-complete projects.

        <ul>
          <!-- Continue to work on list; review current entries and add details-->
          <li>
            <strong>Tower</strong>: primary Unraid server. 16TB HDD, 4TB NVMe,
            64GB DDR4, 17 Docker containers (mostly turned off and not fully
            configured or just not fully utilized -I need systems/habits to
            facilitate some of it.). Roughly 6.5TB of the 16TB are consumed with
            media and documents. I have a cloud backup of the boot media and
            some local backups of the container configurations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hypervisor</strong>: proxmox server with amount of NVMe
            storage and separate drives for yadayada. I've actually used this
            more than I anticipated, but it's also not as cool as I thought it
            would be. It's mostly useful for school, so far.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Synology DiskStation</strong>: 12-bay Synology DiskStation.
            It came with a small NVMe cache drive, and I just haven't made the
            time to reflash the firmware and to install the OS and configure
            another layed of my backup solution. I'd like to avoid backing up
            most of my bulk media storage, but some of that goal depends on me
            figuring out ZFS for my storage drives in my Unraid box.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Laptop</strong>: Primary workstation. Provides local
            repository for personal notes accessed through Obsidian.

          I've continued to run into some technical skill roadblocks, and they
          seem to bring me back to the same thing: I need to learn more.
