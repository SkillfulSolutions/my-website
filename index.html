        I dislike subscription services -saying that I'm not a fan of them is an
        understatement. Recent years have demonstrated (Hulu, Amazon Prime,
        Netflix, Disney, HBO etc.)
        <!-- Add page with archived references for poor quality service -->
        that, despite increasing subscription fees, quality of service for the
        consumer continues to decline. Advertisements are inserted into the
        media, despite having paid to watch it. The media that we originally
        signed up to watch gets pulled from their service so we lose access to
        the content, or the media is moved to a different service so now we have
        to get two subscriptions. The only thing that one might successfully
        argue has improved is convenience associated with the subscription
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having such a perspective, for years, I have felt comfortable streaming
        media online from third-party streaming sites that do not require
        sign-up or charge fees under fair use. Unfortunately, copyright holders
        have been quite proficient at targeting these websites, and the quality
        of service on those websites has since declined quite substantially,
        impacting convenience (as a result, my three-year old knows and uses the
        term 'buffering').
      </p>
      <p>
        My original goal with learning to self-host my own media library was
        admittedly a bit vague: I wanted to do more than have some external hard
        drives with directories of files, but I wasn't certain I wanted to
        venture back into peer-to-peer file sharing after basically a decade of
        not doing so. There is additional risk with file sharing, and technology
        has gotten so complicated! I didn't understand most of what I was doing
        when I was downloading software from random sources on Napster and
        Limewire and cracking the software to use it without a key or using a
        key generator -I just wanted to play Age of Empires! The most recent
        time I'd torrented, I received a nasty-gram from my VPN provider so I
        hadn't attempted that since.
        <small>
          (all of this is completely hypothetical; I would never do something so
          illegal and irresponsible!)

        Eventually, I fell into an echo chamber online that was full of complete
        nerds and digital anarchists, and I didn't quite realize how polarized
        some of the group was initially. That echo chamber led me to learn about
        Linux, open-source software and self-hosting data and services. This
        latter point overlapped neatly with my frustration over lack of digital
        privacy, the normalization of extreme data leaks and leaks of the
        sensitive information of myself, my spouse and my infant child.

      <p>
        The digital anarchists touted a particular suite of software as making
        it elementary to access one's desired media, organize it and make it
        available to users -perfect! This is exactly what I was looking for:
        something presentable, navigable and easy to use for my spouse and small
        children. This suite of software was most easily installed on Linux, and
        I'd been looking to jump-ship from Windows at home for a while. I
        started ordering hardware to convert my desktop gaming pc (I'm more of a
        console guy anyways) to a home media server, installed
        <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php">
          Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)
        </a>
        on my laptop and researched home server operating systems. My interest
        in planning for the future (scalability), desire to customize and lack
        of familiarity with Terminals led me to
        <a href="https://unraid.net/"> Unraid </a>
        , a proprietary operating system based on slackware Linux that is
        wrapped in a friendly GUI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the year, I initiated enough projects that I feel like a golden
        retriever in a tennis ball court. Everything seemed so logical at the
        time, but I look around and see miscellaneous hardware from barely-begun
        or half-complete projects.

      <p id="inventory_list_name">Current hardware and current function:</p>
      <ul>
        <!-- Continue to work on list; review current entries and add details-->
        <li>
          <strong>Tower</strong>: primary Unraid server. 16TB HDD, 4TB NVMe,
          64GB DDR4, 17 Docker containers (mostly turned off and not fully
          configured or just not fully utilized -I need systems/habits to
          facilitate some of it.). Roughly 6.5TB of the 16TB are consumed with
          media and documents. I have a cloud backup of the boot media and some
          local backups of the container configurations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hypervisor</strong>: proxmox server with amount of NVMe
          storage and separate drives for yadayada. I've actually used this more
          than I anticipated, but it's also not as cool as I thought it would
          be. It's mostly useful for school, so far.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Synology DiskStation</strong>: 12-bay Synology DiskStation. It
          came with a small NVMe cache drive, and I just haven't made the time
          to reflash the firmware and to install the OS and configure another
          layed of my backup solution. I'd like to avoid backing up most of my
          bulk media storage, but some of that goal depends on me figuring out
          ZFS for my storage drives in my Unraid box.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Laptop</strong>: Primary workstation. Provides local
          repository for personal notes accessed through Obsidian.

      I've continued to run into some technical skill roadblocks, and they seem
      to bring me back to the same thing: I need to learn more.
