          I strongly dislike subscription services. Recent years with Hulu,
          Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney, and HBO show that, despite rising fees,
          service quality declines. Advertisements intrude on content we've paid
          for, access to certain media is lost, or it moves to other services,
          requiring multiple subscriptions. The only improvement is convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having such a perspective, under fair use, I've relied on third-party
          streaming sites that don't charge fees, though copyright holders have
          increasingly targeted these sites, degrading their quality and
          impacting convenience—my three-year-old now knows the term
          'buffering.'
        </p>
        <p>
          My initial goal in self-hosting my media library was somewhat unclear:
          I wanted more than just external hard drives with file directories,
          but I was hesitant to return to peer-to-peer file sharing after nearly
          a decade away. File sharing carries additional risks, and technology
          has become quite complex. As a boy, I didn't fully understand what I
          was doing while downloading software from random sources on Napster
          and Limewire, cracking software or using key generators —I just wanted
          to play Age of Empires!
          <small id="main_small">
            (all of this is completely hypothetical; I would never do something
            so illegal and irresponsible!)
          </small>
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I found myself in an online echo chamber of digital
          anarchists where I learned about Linux, open-source software and
          self-hosting. These topics resonated with my concerns about digital
          privacy and data leaks involving my family.

        <p>
          The digital anarchists recommended a software suite that simplified
          media access, organization, and sharing—everything I sought for my
          family. This software was best installed on Linux, and I had been
          considering switching from Windows. I began converting my desktop
          gaming PC into a home media server, installed
          <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php" class="link">
            Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)
          </a>
          on my laptop, and researched home server operating systems. My
          interest in scalability, customization, and unfamiliarity with
          Terminals led me to
          <a href="https://unraid.net/" class="link"> Unraid</a>, a
          user-friendly proprietary OS based on Slackware Linux. Within a year,
          I had started numerous projects, feeling overwhelmed by the array of
          unfinished hardware scattered around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the year, I had initiated enough projects that I felt like a
          golden retriever in a tennis ball court. Everything seemed so logical
          at the time, but I look around and see miscellaneous hardware from
          barely-begun or half-complete projects.

        <ul>
          <!-- Continue to work on list; review current entries and add details-->
          <li>
            <strong>Tower</strong>: My Unraid server is the heart of my home
            network, with 16TB HDD for media storage and 4TB NVMe for caching.
            With 64GB of DDR4 RAM, it's running multiple Docker containers,
            although many are currently dormant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hypervisor</strong>: My Proxmox server has exceeded my
            expectations, providing a flexible environment for running virtual
            machines. It's primarily used for school projects and testing
            software.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Synology DiskStation</strong>: My 12-bay Synology
            DiskStation is a powerful storage solution that I plan to configure
            for backups and media storage. The small NVMe cache drive enhances
            performance, but I need to update the firmware first.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Laptop</strong>: My laptop serves as my primary workstation,
            where I manage personal notes and projects using Obsidian. It's
            lightweight and portable, making it perfect for studying on the go.
            It's running Linux Mint Debian Edition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Desktop</strong>: My desktop is a refurbished HP ProDesk 600
            G5 MT. It's just a backup workstation and to test things. It's
            running Linux Mint Debian Edition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Firewall box</strong>: My dedicated firewall box is a HP
            T740 Thin Client. Once I configure it, it will ensure that my home
            network remains secure from external threats and facilitate network
            segregation for personal devices, guest devices and smart-home
            devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>N100 Mini-pc</strong>: My Beelink EQ12 N100 mini-PC is
            perfect for lightweight tasks and serves as an energy-efficient
            machine for additional containers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>RaspberryPi Zero</strong>: This ran DietPi and hosted my
            Pi-Hole DNS sinkhole for ad-blocking, until I accidentally reset the
            power when I was stretching. I had configured it early in my
            learning process so I'll probably reinstall the OS from scratch and
            re-configure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab A9</strong>: Once I configure Immich on
            my Unraid server, this device will act as a self-hosted digital
            photo frame. I want a digital photo frame, but I don't want to share
            my photos or network access with an additional corporation if I can
            avoid it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Too many consumer routers</strong>: Routers for wifi access
            points, routers to act as a switch and bridge to the primary
            network, routers for travel so I can have VPN on all devices in
            hotels.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p id="cloud_services">Cloud services and function:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Codeberg</em>: My Remote repository is for personal notes
            accessed through Obsidian.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Cloud server</em>: *cough* *cough* server space in a
            jurisdiction that is neutral to media copyrights and the DCMA.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I've continued to run into some technical skill roadblocks, and they
          seem to bring me back to the same thing: I need to learn more.
