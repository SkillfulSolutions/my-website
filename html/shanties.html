      <h3>Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)</h3>
      <section class="song">
        <p>
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me<br />
          We pillage, we plunder, we rifle and loot<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />
          We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me<br />
          We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />
          Maraud and embezzle and even hijack,<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me<br />
          We kindle and char, inflame and ignite<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />
          We burn up the city, we're really a fright<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We're rascals, scoundrels, villains, and knaves<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />
          We're devils and black sheep, really bad eggs,<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me<br />
          We're beggars and blighters and ne'er-do-well cads<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />
          Aye, but we're loved by our mommies and dads<br />
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho<br />

      <h3>Hoist the Colours Lyrics</h3>
      <cite class="song_cite">Hans Zimmer</cite>
      <section class="song">
        <p>
          The King and his men<br />
          stole the Queen from her bed<br />
          and bound her in her bones<br />
          the seas be ours and by the powers<br />
          where we will we'll roam<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yo ho, all hands<br />
          Hoist the colors high<br />
          Heave ho, thieves and beggars<br />
          Never shall we die<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now some have died<br />
          and some are alive<br />
          and others sail the sea<br />
          with the keys to the cage<br />
          and the Devil to pay<br />
          we lay to Fiddler's Green.<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yo ho, all hands<br />
          Hoist the colors high<br />
          Heave ho, thieves and beggars<br />
          Never shall we die<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>(repeat)</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yo ho, all together<br />
          Hoist the colors high<br />
          Heave ho, thieves and beggars<br />
          Never shall we die<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The bell has been raised<br />
          from it's watery grave<br />
          Hear it's sepulchral tone?<br />
          A call to all<br />
          pay heed the squall<br />
          and turn yourself toward home<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yo ho, all hands<br />
          Hoist the colors high<br />
          Heave ho, thieves and beggars<br />
          Never shall we die<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yo ho, haul together<br />
          Hoist the colors high<br />
          Heave ho, thieves and beggars<br />
          Never shall we die<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yo ho, haul together<br />
          Hoist the colors high<br />
          Heave ho, thieves and beggars<br />
          Never shall we die..<br />

          The King and his men<br />

        <p>
          Fifteen men on a dead man's chest—<br />
          Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!<br />
